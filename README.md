Your files under your control.

## What is Parallel?

Parallel is a modular, cross-platform file backup and synchronization tool built for people who want full control of their files. It ditches the cloud-first assumptions and gives you full transparency, and control over the how, when, and where your files move. No contracts, no vendor lock-ins, no silent overwrites. Just clean, dependable syncing on your terms.

Parallel was originally built to handle **terabytes of data** because Dropbox simply couldn’t. When commercial cloud services hit their limits, Parallel stepped in to offer **unbounded scale**, **local-first logic**, and **configurable workflows** that respect your storage, your bandwidth, and your rules.

## Why Parallel?

Parallel is completely free and open source. You provide the storage, and Parallel handles the sync. Whether it’s an external drive, a NAS, a remote SSH server, or an S3-compatible cloud like [Storj](https://www.storj.io/) or [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/), Parallel adapts to what you own.

Your computer already gives you enough to fight with — your files don't have to be one of them. Parallel keeps backups simple, transparent, and under your control with no cloud drama.
