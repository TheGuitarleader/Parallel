Your files under your control.

## What is Parallel?

Parallel is a modular, cross-platform file backup and synchronization tool built for people who want full control of their files. It ditches the cloud-first assumptions and gives you full transparency, and control over the how, when, and where your files move. No contracts, no vendor lock-ins, no silent overwrites. Just clean, dependable syncing on your terms.

Parallel was originally built to handle **terabytes of data** because Dropbox simply couldn‚Äôt. When commercial cloud services hit their limits, Parallel stepped in to offer **unbounded scale**, **local-first logic**, and **configurable workflows** that respect your storage, your bandwidth, and your rules.

## Why Parallel?

Parallel is completely free and open source. You provide the storage, and Parallel handles the sync. Whether it‚Äôs an external drive, a NAS, a remote SSH server, or an S3-compatible cloud like [Storj](https://www.storj.io/) or [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/), Parallel adapts to what you own.

Your computer already gives you enough to fight with ‚Äî your files don't have to be one of them. Parallel keeps backups simple, transparent, and under your control with no cloud drama.

dotnet build
```
#### 2. Set Up Your Vaults
Vaults are storage targets where Parallel sends and recieves files. This can be an external drive, NAS share, SSH server, or S3-compatible cloud.
```
parallel vaults create
```
*Note: All vaults are saved as JSON in `%AppData%\Parallel\Vaults` for easy importing and exporting.*
#### 3. Push Files to Vaults
Parallel can push all changed files on the system with:
```
parallel push
```
Or you can specify a path which can be a file or folder.
```
parallel push --path "C:\Windows\System32"
parallel push -p "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"
```
