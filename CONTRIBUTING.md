# Contributing to Parallel

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Parallel! This project is built on transparency, modularity, and control. Whether you're fixing a bug, proposing a feature, or refining architecture, your input helps shape a tool that puts users in better control of their files.

## 🛠 Development Philosophy

Parallel is:
- **Modular**: Each component should be independently testable and replaceable.
- **Audit-friendly**: Changes should be traceable, documented, and intentional.
- **Local-first**: Avoid assumptions about cloud dependencies.
- **Legacy-worthy**: Code should be expressive, maintainable, and built to last.

## 🧱 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**: 
    `git clone https://github.com/TheGuitarleader/Parallel.git`
2. Create a new branch:  
    `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
    `git checkout -b patch/your-patch-name`
3. Make your changes with clear, modular commits.
4. Push and open a **Pull Request** (PR):
    `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
    `git push origin patch/your-patch-name`

## 🔍 Pull Request Guidelines

- Use descriptive titles and commit messages.
- Reference related issues (e.g. `Fixed #42`).
- Include tests for new logic where applicable.
- Keep PRs focused—one feature or fix per PR.
- Be open to feedback and iteration.

## 🧪 Testing Expectations

Parallel uses modular test suites. Before submitting a PR:
- Run all relevant tests.
- Add new ones if your logic introduces new behavior.
- Validate edge cases and failure modes.

## 🧭 Branch Protection & CI/CD

All changes go through PR review. CI/CD pipelines validate builds across platforms. Please ensure your changes pass all checks before requesting review.
